This Nuxt.js app aims to implement a completely front-end project that you can 1- Create a new note, add it to favorites and delete that note. 2- This app tries to provide almost complete functionality of a chat and you can see many features of a chat app in it. Note that all data will be saved and if you use the application with the same IP address, you can see all the data you entered in the chat again.
